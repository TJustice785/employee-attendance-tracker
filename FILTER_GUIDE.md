## 🔧 Technical Details

### Filter Logic:
```javascript
// Search by employee name OR employee ID
matchesSearch = name.includes(searchTerm) || id.includes(searchTerm)

// Filter by exact date match
matchesDate = record.date === selectedDate

// Combined: Must match BOTH conditions
result = matchesSearch AND matchesDate
```

### Performance:
- ⚡ Client-side filtering (instant)
- ⚡ No server round-trip for date filter
- ⚡ Search uses backend API for efficiency
