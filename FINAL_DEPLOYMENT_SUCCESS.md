Open in your browser: https://frontend-production-d160.up.railway.app

### 2. Add Sample Data (Optional)
Connect to your database via MySQL Workbench or run this via Railway dashboard:

```sql
INSERT INTO attendance (employeeName, employeeID, date, status) VALUES
('Liteboho Mokhachane', 'EMP001', '2024-10-27', 'Present'),
('Mpho Nthabiseng', 'EMP002', '2024-10-27', 'Absent'),
('Teboho Lebesa', 'EMP003', '2024-10-27', 'Present'),

## 🔧 Key Technical Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Connection Issue - SOLVED ✅
**Problem:** Backend couldn't connect via Railway's private network  
**Solution:** Used public MySQL proxy URL with proper URL parsing

### 2. URL Parsing for mysql2 - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** mysql2 doesn't support `uri` parameter  
**Solution:** Implemented custom URL parser:
```javascript
const url = new URL(dbUrl);
dbConfig = {
  host: url.hostname,
  user: url.username,
  password: url.password,
  database: url.pathname.substring(1),
  port: url.port || 3306
};
```

### 3. Connection Retry Logic - ADDED ✅
**Feature:** 5 retry attempts with 5-second delays  
**Benefit:** Handles temporary network issues gracefully

### 4. Root Directory Configuration - CONFIGURED ✅
**Backend:** Set to `backend`  
**Frontend:** Set to `frontend`  
**Result:** Proper monorepo deployment

## 💡 Important Notes

### Why Public Proxy Instead of Private Network?
Railway's private network (`mysql.railway.internal`) had persistent timeout issues. The public TCP proxy (`shuttle.proxy.rlwy.net:16162`) works reliably and is still secure as it's only accessible with proper credentials.

### Database Credentials
Your MySQL database credentials are securely stored in Railway environment variables. Never commit them to Git!

### CORS Configuration
Backend is configured to allow requests from:
- `https://frontend-production-d160.up.railway.app`
- `http://localhost:3000` (for local development)
